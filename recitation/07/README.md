## ChatServer

Inside the `edu.cmu.cs.cs214.rec08.samples` package is a Simple GUI program 
which will give you a basic idea of how you can implement the GUIs for 
Tic-Tac-Toe and Scrabble.  Note that like Tic-Tac-Toe and Scrabble, it 
has separate core and GUI components.

Pay attention to how the GUI and core interact with each other. In particular,
notice the way that each ChatPanel is registered as a subscriber to the 
ChatServer.  What design pattern is used here?

Run the `main()` method in `SimpleChatClient.java` to run the ChatServer 
application.  It will present a screen where users can be registered, and 
the "Start Chat" button will open a new chat window for each user.
